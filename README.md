# Lab work for **Django For Everybody** certificate

I've downloaded most of the projects i've done during completion of the certificate

### In the Final project we were building Classified Ad site
###### Here is the list of steps we took:
1. People can view ads without logging in and if they log in, they can create their own ads. It uses a social login that allows loging using github accounts.
2. The can add an image to each ad and add comments for each ad.
3. Added Search capability via Headline, Keywords, Price
